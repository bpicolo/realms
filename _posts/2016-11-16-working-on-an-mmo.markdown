This is the blog post to kick off my blog posts, so I'll keep it short and simple.

I'm trying to make an MMORPG. I have no official name for the game just yet, but I'm going to refer to it as `Realms` for now.

There are plenty of people out there who will tell you not
to work on an MMO of any sort. If you browse around the internet that's certainly the general advice.
It's also advice I've already gotten many times over in Discord and other chats (and I'm only a few weeks in).
Admittedly, for a long time when I was younger I listened to such advice (and frankly, wasn't
a decent enough developer to accomplish anything at the time).

But following discouraging advice has never really been my strong point, so despite all that,
for a few weeks now I've been working on an MMO.

There's a baseline question of "Why?". Why do I want to work on this, despite there
being all other sorts of enjoyable games to work on and the practicality of working
on those instead.

## It's easy.

I've only ever really been interested in MMORPGs. Everquest, RuneScape, Everquest 2, World of Warcraft, Guild Wars,
Guild Wars 2, other-random-Korean-MMOs-trying-to-fill-the-gaps. I like MMORPGs. Rather, I **love**
MMORPGs. They're by far the most fascinating games to me. I love the social-aspects, the lore,
the gameplay... Really the whole shebang. Sure, I've played and enjoyed other games in the meantime,
but no others have clicked in even close to the same way.

The only way I can work on something is if I can be obsessive about it. Being obsessed drives me.
Drives me to work day in and day out, drives me to wake up at 3 AM and have trouble
getting back to sleep because there's a bug to fix that's gnawing at me.

So if that's settled, how do I accomplish what people think is impossible, or at least
extremely impractical?

Well, the trick is avoiding the impossible bits. [Scope creep][1] will kill *any* project.
I'm not trying to make a WoW-killer (wouldn't really be in my best interest anyway, as I enjoy a bit
of WoW on occasion). I'm not trying to *kill* anything, but rather to make my own
tiny contribution to the genre. Perhaps two people will even play it concurrently some day.

There is a point where I'd love to involve the community in the development, but that point
is a ways away. The focus for now is on foundational things that make the game possible, which I'll
surely talk about in upcoming posts.

A side goal is to open-source some relevant components for the next guy who attempts
similar, though I'd like to keep the program as a whole a little closer to heart.
Unity3Ds's UNet is immature, though, so I do expect a lot of pieces to be useful
for other devs as well.

The goal of this blog, on the other hand, partly for the sake of rubber ducking,
parlty to seek out feedback from others in case I go horribly wrong, and partly
fo funsies.

So that's where we are. Attempting to MMO Part 1. Should be fun!
